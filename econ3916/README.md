# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my academic portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**.  
This repository documents my progression from classical econometric foundations to modern machine learning methods, with an emphasis on applying data-driven tools to economic questions.

## 👋 About Me

I am an undergraduate economics student preparing for roles in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance**.  
My academic focus is on bridging **traditional economic theory** with **modern statistical and machine learning techniques** to better understand, model, and predict real-world economic behavior.

This portfolio reflects both my technical development and my approach to learning: building from first principles and extending them into more powerful, scalable methods.

## 📁 About This Portfolio

This repository contains coursework, labs, and experiments developed throughout ECON 3916. The course follows a **concept extension philosophy**, where foundational statistical ideas—such as linear regression—are gradually expanded into machine learning frameworks.

Key themes include:
- Moving from **causal inference** to **predictive modeling**
- Understanding trade-offs between interpretability and performance
- Applying regularization and model selection techniques (e.g., Lasso)
- Using empirical methods to answer economic questions with data

Each folder represents a step in this learning process, combining theory, implementation, and interpretation.
